# üìå Data-Driven Sprint Forecasting with SQL - Solution

## üìù Table creation

First of all, I am going to create the database with all tables and data. I will be using MySQL to do this.

````sql
CREATE TABLE planned (
  sprint_id INT NOT NULL,
  team_hours INT NOT NULL,
  planned_issues INT NOT NULL,
  planned_sp INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (sprint_id)
);
````
````sql
CREATE TABLE results (
  sprint_id INT NOT NULL,
  planned_issues_done INT NOT NULL,
  unplanned_issues_done INT NOT NULL,
  bugs_issues INT NOT NULL,
  planned_sp_done INT NOT NULL,
  unplanned_sp_done INT NOT NULL,
  bugs_sp INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (sprint_id)
);
