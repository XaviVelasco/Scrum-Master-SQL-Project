# üìå Data-Driven Sprint Forecasting with SQL - Solution

## üìù Table creation

I'll start by creating and populating the tables in the _scrum_master_ database using **MySQL Workbench**.

<details>
  <summary>TABLE 1: <i>planned</i></summary>
  
````sql
CREATE TABLE scrum_master.planned (
  sprint_id INT NOT NULL,
  team_hours INT NOT NULL,
  planned_issues INT NOT NULL,
  planned_sp INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (sprint_id)
);

INSERT INTO scrum_master.planned (
  sprint_id,
  team_hours,
  planned_issues,
  planned_sp
  )
VALUES

## ‚ùì Questions and Answers

<details>
  <summary>1. <b>Velocity</b>: What is the team's average velocity (story points completed)?</summary>
<br>

- Taking in account all the springs:

````sql
SELECT COUNT(sprint_id) AS Sprints, ROUND(AVG(planned_sp_done + unplanned_sp_done)) AS Avg_SP_Done
FROM results;
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91a2acc2-8327-4a7f-990b-3be3a28e5c46)

There are 26 sprints in total, and **the overall average story points done are 87**. 

- Considering only the last 5 sprints:

````sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(planned_sp_done + unplanned_sp_done)) AS Avg_SP_Done
FROM results
WHERE sprint_id >= (
    SELECT MAX(sprint_id) - 4
    FROM results
    );
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/713df9e7-f33e-4900-8575-92a781a7dda3)

In this case, **the average story points done are 64**.

  <summary>2. <b>Peak Performance:</b> When did the team achieve its best overall performance in terms of story points completed?</summary>
<br>
  
- Taking in account all the springs:
  
````sql
SELECT sprint_id AS Sprint, (planned_sp_done + unplanned_sp_done) AS Total_SP
FROM results
ORDER BY Total_SP DESC
LIMIT 1;
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/425fe96b-e07c-48de-a49e-e214994a2616)

The team achieved its best overall performance in **sprint 61 with 137 story points**.

- Considering only the last 5 sprints:
  
````sql
SELECT sprint_id AS Sprint,  (planned_sp_done + unplanned_sp_done) AS Total_SP
FROM results
WHERE sprint_id >= (
  SELECT MAX(sprint_id) - 4
  FROM results
  )
ORDER BY Total_SP DESC
LIMIT 1;
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/043528a0-b16a-4d97-900a-4754bb904f95)

Regarding only the last 5 sprints, the team achieved its best performance in **sprint 63 with 72 story points**.

  <summary>3. <b>Efficiency:</b>How efficiently is the team utilizing its available hours?</summary>
<br>

- First of all, I will calculate which sprints were the most and least efficient by dividing the total story points by the team hours. I'll also find the average efficiency. 

_MIN EFFICIENCY:_

````sql
SELECT results.sprint_id AS sprint, ROUND((planned_sp_done + unplanned_sp_done) / (team_hours),3) AS Min_Efficiency
FROM results
JOIN planned ON results.sprint_id = planned.sprint_id
GROUP BY sprint
ORDER BY Min_Efficiency ASC
LIMIT 1;
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0efb3a71-5061-42db-8cab-f304a06be630)

**Min efficiency:** At sprint 62, having 0.1403 story points per hour.

_MAX EFFICIENCY:_
````sql
SELECT results.sprint_id AS sprint, ROUND((planned_sp_done + unplanned_sp_done) / (team_hours),3) AS Max_Efficiency
FROM results
JOIN planned ON results.sprint_id = planned.sprint_id
GROUP BY sprint
ORDER BY Max_Efficiency DESC
LIMIT 1;
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b1c064-7fee-4cbe-aa9b-aae8a45946f1)

**Max efficiency:** At sprint 58, having 0.296 story points per hour.

_AVG EFFICIENCY:_
````sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(planned_sp_done + unplanned_sp_done) / AVG(team_hours), 3) AS Avg_Efficiency
FROM results
JOIN planned ON results.sprint_id = planned.sprint_id;
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/617d39a5-b08d-4a5a-ac98-2a4e2f4a7973)

**Avg efficiency:** On average, the team does 0.199 story points per hour.

- Now I will calculate average sprint efficiency by dividing total story points by team hours:
  
````sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(planned_sp_done + unplanned_sp_done) / SUM(team_hours), 3) AS Avg_Efficiency
FROM results
JOIN planned ON results.sprint_id = planned.sprint_id
GROUP BY Avg_Efficiency;
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5446861a-f5b2-452c-8ab4-5b6d6cccf26d)

**Average efficiency** 0.296.
