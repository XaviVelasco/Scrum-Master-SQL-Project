# üìå Data-Driven Sprint Forecasting with SQL - Solution

## üìù Table creation

First of all, I am going to create the database with all tables and data. I will be using MySQL to do this.

````sql
CREATE TABLE planned (
  sprint_id INT NOT NULL,
  team_hours INT NOT NULL,
  planned_issues INT NOT NULL,
  planned_sp INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (sprint_id)
);

INSERT INTO planned (sprint_id, team_hours, planned_issues, planned_sp)
VALUES (41, 535, 16, 104),
  (42, 513, 16, 108),
  (43, 374, 12, 80),
  (44, 411, 14, 89),
  (45, 397, 14, 95),
  (46, 437, 16, 98),
  (47, 435, 17, 112),
  (48, 334, 14, 82),
  (49, 453, 19, 105),
  (50, 527, 23, 123),
  (51, 343, 16, 98),
  (52, 399, 19, 120),
  (53, 402, 20, 115),
  (54, 314, 16, 83),
  (55, 520, 21, 107),
  (56, 535, 23, 102),
  (57, 378, 19, 79),
  (58, 311, 14, 77),
  (59, 549, 21, 103),
  (60, 522, 21, 113),
  (61, 515, 26, 136),
  (62, 449, 19, 84),
  (63, 509, 18, 65),
  (64, 394, 13, 57),
  (65, 431, 17, 67),
  (66, 364, 11, 61);
