# ðŸ“Š Scrum Master's SQL queries

## :eye: Overview

As a Scrum Master, I developed this dashboard to monitor and manage the performance of the development team. I have continuously adapted and added new features and visualizations as needed. Currently, I update the dashboard whenever I require new insights or need to analyze data for forecasting.

This Excel workbook offers a comprehensive overview of a Scrum team's performance, organized into three worksheets:

- Sprint_details
- Data 
- Pivot Tables
- Dashboard

## :abacus: Skills and formulas used

This project demonstrates a range of data analysis skills that are crucial for understanding the performance of a Scrum team, including data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization, as well as the application of various Excel formulas and tools. Below is a detailed breakdown of the skills and specific Excel functions utilized:

- **Data Management**:
     - Data Backup and Handling: Ensuring data integrity by maintaining backup sheets.
     - Manual Data Entry and Validation: Ensuring that all sprint data is accurately entered and validated, eliminating errors that could affect calculations and visualizations.
     - Data Cleaning: Preparing the raw data for analysis, removing inconsistencies and ensuring accuracy.
     - Data Structuring: Organizing data in a table format with clear headers and consistent data types, making it easier to analyze and create pivot tables. Cross-sheet references to ensure that the data is always consistent.
     - Conditional Formatting: To highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) and other important data points visually.


- **Analytical Skills**:
     - PivotTables: Used to dynamically summarize data, allowing for quick analysis of key metrics across different sprints.
     - Filtering and Slicing: Pivot tables enable quick filtering of data by sprint, issue type, or any other relevant category, which helps in identifying trends and making data-driven decisions.

- **Visualization Skills**:

     - Dashboard Creation: Crafting a dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends, making complex data easily understandable.
     - Conditional Formatting: Used to highlight important data points, such as compliance rates and sprint performance, providing quick visual cues.

- **Formulas and Functions**:

     - This Excel contains advanced use of Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, SUM, AVERAGE, ROUNDUP, and arithmetic operations to process and analyze the data.
